# Analysis

1. Pick 3 of the 10 categories. For each, pick a language that gives it to you for free and say what that language pays for it. "Python has dictionaries" isn't an answer. What does Python's dictionary cost in memory or in speed compared to what you built, and where would you notice?  
    - **String**  
    Java implements strings by building an immutable String object in the case of declaration of a string via a string literal. This helps save memory by storing the string in a String constant pool, allowing variables to simply point to the same reference.  
2. You wrote the tag check in `dt_value_as_int` by hand. Some languages don't let you. They make the tagged union a language construct, so the compiler writes the check for you, refuses to compile a read that skips it, and refuses to compile a set of cases that misses one. Rust's `enum` and `match` work this way, and so do ML's datatypes and Swift's enumerations with associated values. What does the C version let you do that a compiler enforcing the check wouldn't, and is any of it worth wanting?
